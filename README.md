# JAC Maps
Have you ever felt lost at John Abbott College? JACMaps was designed to help students navigate their way to different classrooms.
JACMaps is a google map inspired application with the capability of giving students directions from one classroom to another!

All you need to do is input the class you're in, and the class you're going to and you will have step by step directions to get you there! And yes, it works with stairs!
